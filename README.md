# FTGS Player

A minimal browser player for animated Vanilla `.ftgs.ply` files. Rendering uses
native WebGL2, with depth sorting in a Web Worker. It runs directly as a static
site without runtime dependencies.

**[Open the player](https://opsiclear-4dgs.github.io/ftgs-player/)** ·

Drop a `.ftgs.ply` onto the page, or click to choose a file. Playback starts
automatically and loops. The scene fills the window, with a full-width timeline
and playback controls along the bottom. The controls fade during playback and
return on movement or touch. Hover over the timeline to preview a time; use the
folder button to open another file. Local files stay in the browser.

## Embed in another project

The [embedding API](API.md) provides `FTGSPlayer` for your own canvas and
`FTGSEmbed` for an iframe, including the hosted player. Both expose `load`,
`play`, `pause`, `seek`, camera controls, lifecycle events, and `destroy`.
Canvas instances are independent; iframe commands work across origins.
See the runnable [canvas example](examples/embedding.html) and
[iframe example](examples/embedding.html?mode=iframe), plus the React lifecycle
example in the API guide. No runtime dependencies are required.

## Run locally

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open <http://localhost:8765/>. Serve the page over HTTP; opening `index.html`
directly cannot load its modules and worker. Add `?demo=1` to play a synthetic
ribbon generated in the browser. No model downloads are included in this repo.

## GitHub Pages and model links

This repository publishes directly from the root of `main`. In a fork, enable
**Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main → / (root)**. The `.nojekyll`
file keeps it a static site. Relative asset and worker paths support project
URLs such as `/ftgs-player/` and other static hosts.

To load an HTTP(S) model URL, link with `?src=` followed by its URL-encoded address.
The model host must allow cross-origin requests when it is on a different origin.
The page can be hosted as static files; it has no application server, analytics,
or remote assets.

For a captured scene, a camera inside the capture area can give a much better
initial view than fitting all points. A model link can include `fps=24`, `30` or
`60`, and a URL-encoded JSON `view` parameter, for example:

```js
const query = new URLSearchParams({
  src: "results/scene.ftgs.ply",
  fps: "60",
  view: JSON.stringify({ eye: [0, -1, 0.3], target: [0, 0, 0], up: "z", fov: 45 }),
});
const link = new URL("https://opsiclear-4dgs.github.io/ftgs-player/");
link.search = query.toString();
// Eye and target use the model's coordinate system.
```

`up` is `y` or `z`; `fov` is the vertical field of view in degrees (10–120).
R restores this bookmarked view for its model. These are player settings;
the FTGS file itself does not store capture cameras or frame rate.

## Controls

| Action | Control |
| --- | --- |
| Play / pause | Play button or Space |
| Seek / step | Timeline, or Left / Right for one frame |
| Open another file | Folder button, O, or drop anywhere |
| Orbit | Left drag / one-finger drag |
| Pan | Right drag, Shift + drag, or two-finger drag |
| Zoom | Scroll / pinch |
| Move forward / backward | W / S |
| Strafe left / right | A / D |
| Move down / up | Q / E |
| Move faster | Hold Shift (4× speed) |
| Fit camera / restore saved view | Reset view button or R |
| Switch Y up / Z up | U |
| Fullscreen | Fullscreen button or F |

Shortcuts apply when the canvas or page has focus, leaving form controls' keys
available normally. The controls remain visible while paused or focused with the
keyboard.

Click or Tab into the scene to use movement keys. Movement follows your viewing
direction, with speed scaled to the scene and zoom level; Q/E follows the Y or Z
up axis. The keys work during playback and while paused. Releasing a key, focusing
another control, or leaving the tab stops movement. Browser shortcuts and text
fields keep their usual behavior. Movement uses the physical WASD/QE key positions.

## Format and rendering

The reader supports the documented [FTGS v1 layout](FORMAT.md):
binary little-endian float32 PLY, normalized time, and SH degrees 0–3. It
reconstructs anisotropic covariance from log-scales and wxyz rotations, evaluates
SH color, temporal opacity and optional velocity, and sorts animated centers
back to front in a worker before drawing splats. Ordinary static PLY
and `.pt` checkpoints are not inputs to this player.

The frame count comes from `n_frames` when present. Playback defaults to 30 fps,
which is a player setting rather than information stored in FTGS v1. For files
without a frame count, the default is 300; `?frames=120` overrides it. Frame `i`
maps to normalized time `i / max(n_frames - 1, 1)`.

The default point limit is **1 million**, sampled evenly throughout the file.
A brief loading notice reports when sampling is active. URL options keep the
view free of settings panels: `?points=all` loads the complete model,
`?points=250000` lowers the limit, `?resolution=half` lowers render resolution,
and `?up=z` starts with Z up. Combine options with `&` after the first `?`.
Large files still need enough browser memory to load the file and its selected
points; this version does not stream models. GPU texture limits and available
memory may prevent very large models loading.

This is a preview renderer, not a pixel-identical implementation of the CUDA
trainer. Depth sorting uses 65,536 bins; the rasterizer truncates Gaussians at
three standard deviations and drops contributions below 1/255. WebGL2 and browser
hardware acceleration are required. Camera fitting uses the central 98% of
canonical positions to avoid distant reconstruction outliers.

## Development checks

Parser, covariance, temporal sorting and demo checks use Node's built-in runner
(Node 20+), without installing packages:

```bash
npm test
```

An optional browser smoke check exercises rendering, seeking, orbiting, looping,
file-error recovery, URL loading and the mobile layout. It needs Python's
`playwright` and `Pillow` packages plus Playwright Chromium. These are test tools,
not player dependencies:

```bash
uv run --no-project --with playwright --with pillow python -m playwright install chromium
uv run --no-project --with playwright --with pillow python tests/browser_smoke.py
```

Pass `--browser /path/to/chromium` to use an existing browser, `--model
/path/to/scene.ftgs.ply` to additionally check a real exported file through both
file and URL loading, and `--screenshots /tmp/ftgs-player` to save screenshots.
The smoke test serves the app at `/ftgs-player/` to check GitHub Pages path
handling as well as playback.

The API integration check covers independent canvases, cross-origin iframe
commands, lifecycle events, cancellation, cleanup, and remounting:

```bash
uv run --no-project --with playwright python tests/browser_api.py
```

It also accepts `--browser /path/to/chromium`.
